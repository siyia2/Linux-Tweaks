To use my configs for I/O scheduling and write-cache place 60-ioschedulers.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/
and sysctl.conf in /etc/ or /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf depending on disto, then sysctl -p as root or reboot.
If available RAM is <=4GB use the sysctl.conf inside the low RAM scenario folder, in combination with a zram device.
