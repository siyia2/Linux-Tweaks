Templates for some useful services for systemd.
To use any/all of the services as templates download and copy them to your ~/Templates and /root/Templates/ folders
if the folders don't exist simply create them.

To use any/all of those services simply copy them to /usr/lib/systemd/system folder/
from there on modify them according to your needs and use the systemctl tool from terminal.

systemctl start example.service ---> starts the service immediatelly
systemctl stop example.service ---> stops the service immediatelly
systemctl disable example.service ---> disables the service
systemctl status example.service ---> gives status of the service
