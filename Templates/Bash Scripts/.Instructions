Templates for common bash scripts with paramaters that i find often useful.

To use any/all of the bash scripts as templates download them and copy them to your ~/Templates and /root/Templates/ folders
if the folders dont exist simply create them.

To simply start a bash script as user at startup, add one of them to your autostart according to your DE

If you need to run a scrip at startup with root privilages you ll have to create a systemd .service and call the script via
ExecStart="path to script"

An easy way to have one or more of these bash scripts be called before/after suspend/resume is to copy them at the
/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ directory and make sure they are executable.Once you resume you pc, systemd will execute the scripts
present in the folder above, both before and after suspend, but the commands executed iside the scripts 
will be dictated according to the specific rules of each bash script.
