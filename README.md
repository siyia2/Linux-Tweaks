# Linux-Tweaks

Hello in this small repository i am trying to help people (and hopefully myself too) config and optmize their linux systems mostly for desktop usage,
i am doing my best to describe each config in simple layman's terms with instructions so that the average user understands how to setup helpful configs for their system.

# Current Topics:

* Cahe & I/O config

* Laptop quirks (under constr)

* Many scripts and services the average layman would find handy

* Various programs configs that i use

* Wayland desktop setup (currently only under sway)

* Zram setup
