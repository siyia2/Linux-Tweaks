# Linux-Tweaks

Hello, this repository aims in trying to help people (and hopefully myself too) config and optimize their linux systems mostly for daily desktop usage. I am doing my best to describe each config in simple layman's terms with instructions, so that the average user understands how to setup helpful configs for their desktop system. This repo also serves as a personal backup for my config files and systems setup.

# Current Topics:

* Various programs configs that i use

* Collection of fixed DSDTS

* Cahe & I/O configs

* Laptop quirks

* General quirks

* Useful templates for scripts & services

* Wayland desktop setup (currently only under sway)

* Zram setup
