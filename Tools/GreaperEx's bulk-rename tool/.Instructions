This is an awesome bulk-rename tool is made by my good friend Greaperx written in C.
You can check his github profile at : https://github.com/GReaperEx .

The main focus of this program is to set the dir/subdirs/files under a specified fs path to either

LOWER CASE, UPPER CASE or INVERTED CASE 

This is especially useful if you have A case-sensitive fs and want to play mods from windows games in linux.

To use either download the source file and compile it with : gcc -Wall -O2 -o bulk-rename bulk-rename.c
This will create a bulk-rename executable file, mark it as executable for it to work.
Or download the binary straight up and make it executable.
Works only on case-sensitive directories even if they are inside a case-insensitive fs.
Type ./bulk-rename -h for help in a terminal.

EXAMPLES OF USE:

./bulk-rename  /home/siyia2/Random_Folder
(makes everything in the specified path to LOWER CASE which is essential for mods, including the targeted folder)

./bulk-rename  -L /home/siyia2/Random_Folder
(makes everything in the specified path to UPPER CASE, including the targeted folder)

./bulk-rename  -I /home/siyia2/Random_Folder
(makes everything in the specified path to INVERTED CASE, including the targeted folder)

./bulk-rename  -i /home/siyia2/Random_Folder
(INVERTS only folders/files with mixed UPPER/LOWER CASE in the specified path, including the targeted folder)

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE FILE PATH THAT YOU SPECIFY THE PROGRAM TO RENAME INTO !!!
IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY RENAME YOUR ROOT HOME OR OTHER IMPORTANT SYSTEM FOLDERS, THERE IS NO WAY TO RENAME THEM BACK WITH THIS TOOL !!!!!
