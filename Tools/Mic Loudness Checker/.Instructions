Bash script that checks if your voice is louder than a certain threshold, it works in two mods NIGHTMOD & DAYMOD
It requires the sox package and an audio file placed at ~/Documents/bark.ogg and uses ALSA.
You might need to adjust different threshold levels for your specific mic device and tolerances.
