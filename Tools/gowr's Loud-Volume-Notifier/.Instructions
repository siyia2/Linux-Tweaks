Mic alarm notifier, when mic reaches a certain threshold bark.ogg emerges to haunt you!

To compile & run:
1) Edit threshold, sample numbers and audio file path to your own preferences
2) Run gcc -Wall -O2 -o level level.c
3) Finally chmod +x level

To install:
1) Make sure you have the sox package installed on your favorite distro
2) Place bark.ogg in ~/Music/bark.ogg, if you have changed default audio path, place it accordingly

To Use:
1) You can optionally place threshold limt upon executing the program f.e level.out 0.310000
2) Place the files from folder Service&Timer to ~/.local/share/systemd/user and level to ~/.local//bin/mic-alarm, or you can just run level from terminal
3) Enable the timer with systemctl --user enable mic-alarm.timer

There might be a spamming issue if you use bash instead of zsh as the default shell, in my case i use zsh.

Special credits go to my Friend GoWR who made this possible.
