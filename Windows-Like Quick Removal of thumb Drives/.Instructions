In order to enable similar behavior like windows quick-removal of external usb drives globally,
add the file 100-removable.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/, then reboot.

This works globally only for fat32 systems in Linux.

For ntfs use gnome-disks and enable sync:

Open gnome-disks and edit the mount options for your ntfs thumb drive

Click the button to allow change in user defaults and set the following mount options:

sync,noatime,nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show,umask=002

then set identify as /dev/disk/by-id/ and then press ok and enter your password.
Now every time you mount the specific drive it will mount automatically with the sync option consistently after reboots.
If you want other ntfs devices to behave this way add them in the same way.

Pros:
Being able to quick-remove your external drives.

Cons:
Is a little slower.
There are no guarantees.
