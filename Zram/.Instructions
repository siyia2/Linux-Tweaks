The best way in my opinion to setup a zram disk drive with your preferred compression/disksize:

1) Disable all automated services and scripts that setup zram in your system.
2) Add the zram script in this repo in your /usr/bin/ and make it executable.
3) Add the zram.service file in /lib/systemd/system/ and enable it with systemctl enable zram.service.

The above three steps will configure a zram disk at the size of 2G (18% of my 12gb) using zstd compression.
Changes take effect on boot and stay persistent after suspend/restart.

Additional info:
Zram Drive: Uses dynamically a specified part of your memory as a compressed ram cache, effectively maximizing your available
ram capacity, useful for systems with low ram and/or  when adding more ram is not an option.

Zram compression algs currently supported in kernel 5.4+: LZ4, LZO, ZSTD, LZO-RLE (default).

If you wish to change the compression algorithm, or zram device size edit the zram script to accommodate your needs. 
For most modern systems, i recommend adding the zstd compression alg and 50% of your ram as zram.
The zram device according to my script, will always have maximum priority.
