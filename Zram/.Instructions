The best way in my opinion to setup a zram disk drive with your preferred compression/disksize:

1) Disable all automated services and scripts that setup zram in your system.
2) Add the zram script in this repo in your /usr/bin and make it executable.
3) Add the zram.service file in /lib/systemd/system and enable it with systemctl enable zram.service.

The above three steps will configure a zram disk at the size of 2G (18% of my 12gb) using zstd compression.
Changes take effect on boot and stay persistent after suspend/restart.

Additional info:
Zram Drive: Dedicates a part of your memory as a compressed ram cache, effectively maximizing your available
ram capacity, useful for systems with low ram and/or  when adding more ram is not an option.

Zram Allocators: zbud(default, 2 compressed objects are stored into 1 page),z3fold(3 compressed objects are stored into 1 page).

Zram compression algs currently supported in kernel 5.4+: LZ4, LZO, ZSTD, LZO-RLE (default).

If you wish to change the compression algorithm,allocator or zram size edit the zram script to accommodate your needs.
The zram device according to my script, will always have maximum priority.
