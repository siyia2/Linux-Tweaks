Edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf & uncomment:

HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore

This alone should suffice for modern laptops. If wifi still disconnects on lid close:

1) Install acpid.
2) Install rfkill.
2) Put the file called lidconf in /etc/acpi/events.
3) Put lid.sh into /etc/acpi/actions/ and make sure it is executable.
4) systemctl enable acpid && systemctl start acpid.
